  - heading: Brief Description
    text: Haunted Mansion is an FPS style 3D game. I made this game for a game jam
      but soon realized that my desktop build was too large to upload to the server,
      and the WebGL build wouldn't even run.  I put it aside for 9 months before working
      on it again. It is the 2nd game I've made so far. Most of the techniques I've
      used were learned from completing The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with
      Unity by Jon Weinberger of GameDevHQ.com

      to interact with anything under the crosshair (white dot.) Press E to equip
      weapon and left-mouse click to Fire. When out of Mana, recharge by standing
      next to Mana Crystal located under the stairs.
